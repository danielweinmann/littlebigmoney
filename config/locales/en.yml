      title_money: "Where does the money to finance projects come from?"

      title_work: "Does it take a lot of time?"

      title: "Almost there!"
      subtitle: "Before submitting your project, it's good to think over a few important points."
      introduction_html: "We know you can't wait to have your project online, but first answer <br> (in a piece of paper) the following questions"
      legend_html: "Having clear answers to these questions will help tremendously<br> in structuring your project, increasing the chances of its success"
      title_one: "What inspired you to make this project?"
      tip_one: "People only engage when they realize the importance of a cause for society or for the person who leads a campaign. So be very clear about what is your inspiration and let it overflow into your project."
      title_two: "What is the focus?"
      tip_two: "LittleBigMoney is an excellent tool to give a boost to your ideas. Therefore, define the purpose of your project objectively, as well as who will benefit from it. Clearly defining your goals is one of the best ways to engage people."
      title_three: "What is your goal?"
      tip_three: "Calculate all costs for the project execution and rewards delivery. Also take into account your ability to engage people in order to define your financial goal."
      title_four: "What is your deadline to raise the support?"
      tip_four: "The maximum deadline is 90 days, but remember: don't underestimate the amount of work that goes into a campaign. You will have to work hard before and during the campaign if you want to succeed. It is important to keep enthusiasm and not get worn out, which is why we recommend you 45 or 60 days of campaign."
      title_five: "Have you thought about your project's rewards?"
      tip_five: "Remember that rewards are public promises. So, think very well while you elaborate them, as well as the logistics in delivering them to your supporters. Our suggestion: think about immaterial rewards: downloads, experiences, courses, products, kisses and hugs!"
      title_six: "Is your video ready?"
      tip_six: "The video is the business card of your project. It's through it that the supporters will get in touch with your cause. So, take special care in the script, audio and image quality. HD is recommended."
      title_seven: "How will you mobilize your network?"
      tip_seven: "It is important to plan strategically to mobilize networks and convince them to support your project, both before and during the period of project completion. We recommend distributing your work weekly with your network according to the proximity you achieve with your supporters."
      title_eight: "How will the money be used?"
      tip_eight: "Create a GOOGLE DOCS spreadsheet and open your budget to show everyone how the support will be used. TRANSPARENCY is everything in this project."
